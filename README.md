## Module3 Coding Assignment (Coursera course: HTML, CSS, and Javascript for Web Developers by John Hopkins)

### Module 4 Assignment Instructions.

The idea of this assignment is to take an existing array of names and then output either Hello 'Name' or Good Bye 'Name' to the console.
The program should say "Hello" to any name except names that start with a "J" or "j", otherwise, the program should say "Good Bye". So, the final output
on the console should look like this:

Hello Yaakov <br>
Good Bye John <br>
Good Bye Jen <br>
Good Bye Jason <br>
Hello Paul <br>
Hello Frank <br>
Hello Larry <br>
Hello Paula <br>
Hello Laura <br>
Good Bye Jim
